# RESTO
A restaurant website designed using MERN stack

**This project is NOT responsive YET. I am currently working on backend**

To use this project after cloning it 
write the following in your CLI: 

Step: 1 - npm install
          This will install all the required packages that are essential to run the website.

Step: 2- nodemon app.js

Step 3 - Go to any browser you prefer and search "localhost:3000". This will redirect you to the home page of the website.
